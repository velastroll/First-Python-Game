# First-Python-Game

Hi!
Yes, the code is very simple, but its my first own game.
STEPS:
- Its necessary to have pygtk and a python IDLE.
- Download de folder 'images' and put it next to the game.py to play correctly.

For anything, send me a message here or in twitter (@Velastroll).
(I hope to improve my english in the next apps)
Enjoy & see you soon!
